 The rules of the game are simple. They are:

 * PLayers take turns rolling two dice
 * If once dice shows one the player losses of the winnings for that round
   and player two takes the turn
 * If both dice show one player loses all the winnings of the entire game
   and player two takes the turn
 * Player can choose to pass turn instead of risking lossing all the winnings
 * First player to reach 100 points wins the game
